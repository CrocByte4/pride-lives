# pride-lives

Project - An LGBT+ information and support site

Project name - Pride Lives

Made by - Joe Price

Description - Meant to be a learning and support resource for LGBT+ topics

What problems does this project solve? - There are limits to what is taught in a school based on the political climate at the time, which leads to a lack of knowledge of LGBT+ topics. This website provides this information both to help users understand others and themselves. There is a support page which will display advice and resources based on the user's inputted nationality.
