function 

// survey function
// ask a variety of questions, can include yes/no, pick from list of cat, pick country, etc
// data is stored in local memory and used for charts
// some answers will change other pages, e.g user's country will be default in support and rights pages, their identity flag will appear on index page on subsequent visits maybe even a custom page theme (colours, symbols, people{changable person of the day}) etc.
// maybe add user comments to a new page, like a support wall or experiences ...

// chart stuff
// pie chart may be best for visuals

// thinking of adding a person of the day to index, maybe a link to wikipedia articles, could show a picture and short excerpt of article as well as link to it

// this may be simple, but a visitor counter

// maybe add a quiz based on the info in the cat pages to seee what the user learned, and keep track of the attempts and high score
// have a variety of questions, pulled at random
